AXON SALES AND PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS:

Problem Statement:

A small company, “Axon”, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

Aim:

The goal of the project is to design and implement a BI solution using PowerBI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively.

Recommendations:

1.	So far, the company has a stronghold in USA and European countries like France and Spain. Conducting market research on favourable products in other countries and   focussing on them could result in increase in sales in the other countries as well.
2. Maximum profit could be achieved if the products were sold more close to the MSRP rate suggested by the vendors.
